# Responsive Landing Page

This is a responsive landing page, which was made using htm5, sass, and javascript.

the page was made perfectly like a design file, which I found on figma. (pixel perfect)

i don't know why but sometimes on github pages i'm getting an error that doesn't load the card images in the testimonials section
